        "text": "Hofmann introduced a systematic approach to design that was radical in its simplicity. He emphasized that design isn't about decoration, but about finding the essential form of communication. His famous 'dot, line, and plane' exercises helped students understand the fundamental elements of visual composition."

      {
        "speaker": "Guest",
        "text": "Absolutely. Hofmann believed that contrast was the driving force of good design. He wasn't just talking about black and base-light, but about the interplay between forms, sizes, and textures. His posters for the Basel Theater are perfect examples – they achieve maximum impact with minimal elements."

        "speaker": "Guest",
        "text": "I think he would be pleased to see his principles surviving, but perhaps concerned about their superficial application. He was about depth of understanding, not just aesthetic mimicry. He wanted designers to truly understand why a composition works, not just copy a style."
